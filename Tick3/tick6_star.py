'''
1. Random guesser: knows the overall distribution of the categories and chooses between them according to that proportion.
2. Happy random guesser: chooses positive 60% of the time, neutral 20%, negative 20%.
3. Doesnâ€™t sit on the fence: chooses positive 50% of the time, negative 50% of the time.
4. Middle of the road: chooses neutral 80% of the time.
Code some number of random agents and let them make choices for 50 examples and calculate kappa. Repeat this exercise 100 times.
